# Pokefight
Created by Farhan Uddin

You are given a random pokemon from the PokéAPI. See if it beats the computer's pokemon!
Matches are won if all your pokemon's stats added up are greater than the computer's pokemon.
Click the Fight Button to get new matchups! 
Some images may not load, that is due to the PokéAPI not having an available image.

I plan on adding more to this project, so stay tuned.
